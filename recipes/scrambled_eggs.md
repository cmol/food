Implementation
--------------
```
01: Whisk eggs together with chives and sour cream.
    It is important to get an even mix with lots of air.
02: Add butter and egg mix to a casserole or pan on low heat.
    The idea is that the eggs should not brown. If they brown the pan
    is too hot. It is not the end of the da if they brown and they are
    still edible; just not as good.
03: Slowly and carefully fold the mixture onto itself.
    The thing to look for here is that the scramble should stay in
    large chuncks.
The scramled eggs are finished when they have just firmed up. It
should still be moist.
